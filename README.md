# Knuth Mastermind Solver

Let the AI **crack your secret color code** or challenge yourself in a game of *Mastermind*!  
This project implements [Knuth’s optimal algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)#Five-guess_algorithm),  
which efficiently reduces all possible combinations to solve any Mastermind code in five or fewer moves.

## Features
- Fast, intelligent code-breaking powered by Knuth’s algorithm  
- Playable human vs. AI game mode  
- Clean, modular Python design  
- Demonstrates applied **AI search and optimization**
